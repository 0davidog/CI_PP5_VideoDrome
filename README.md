## Agile Process

This project is to be made using Agile develpment pricipals to plan and complete the work to a minimum viable product. This involves seperating the work in to a project back log of user stories in which an iteration of the project (MVP) must be achieved by project deadline.

### User Stories

Following Agile development practice this project has been divided into user stories to give a clear understanding of the project needs, goals and features and to split the work in to small achievable sets of tasks.

### Project Backlog

Due to the small scope of this project, having a project backlog and seperate iterations didn't seem neccessary as their would only be one project to client hand-over. It was instead decided to keep all the user stories in the one project iteration list. A project backlog milestone was created however on github to follow agile practice.

[Project Backlog](https://github.com/0davidog/VideoDrome/milestone/2)

### Iteration 01 â€“ Due 04/06/2024

[Iteration on Github](https://github.com/0davidog/VideoDrome/milestone/1)

As this is an accedemic porfolio project there is only one interation in which this project will be developed and tested. That being the project start date to it's hand-in date by which all its must-have deliverables are to be achieved.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

This project requires some steps in preparation...

### Heroku Postgres Database:

<details><summary>DETAILS</summary>

Configuring your Django project to use Heroku Postgres involves several steps, including setting up the database configuration, installing necessary dependencies, and adjusting settings for deployment. Here's a general guide to help you migrate your Django project to Heroku Postgres:

Install Required Dependencies:
Ensure you have the dj-database-url package installed. This package allows you to utilize environment variables to configure your database connection.

```pip install dj-database-url```

Update requirements.txt:
If you haven't already, make sure to update your requirements.txt file with any new dependencies, including dj-database-url.

Update Django Settings:
In your Django project settings (typically settings.py), import dj_database_url and update the DATABASES setting to use environment variables for database configuration.

```
import dj_database_url

# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#databases

if 'HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_TEAL_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_TEAL_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```

This configuration allows Django to automatically use the DATABASE_URL environment variable provided by Heroku to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

Set Environment Variables:
In your Heroku app settings, set the DATABASE_URL environment variable to the connection URL of your Heroku Postgres database. You can find this URL in the Heroku dashboard under the "Settings" tab.

Migrate Database:
Before deploying your Django app to Heroku, you need to migrate your database schema to Heroku Postgres.

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Collect Static Files:
If your Django project serves static files, you may need to collect them before deploying to Heroku.

```
heroku run python manage.py collectstatic
```

Deploy to Heroku:
Once you've made these changes, commit your code to your Git repository and deploy your Django app to Heroku using Git.

```
git push
```

Verify Deployment:
After deployment, you can verify that your Django app is running correctly on Heroku by visiting your Heroku app's URL in a web browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully migrate your Django project to Heroku Postgres. Make sure to test your application thoroughly after deployment to ensure everything is working as expected. If you encounter any issues, Heroku provides detailed documentation and support resources to assist you further.

- Press Enter to create your local clone.

Source: [Github Docs]([https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

</details>

### Local Deployment

<details><summary>DETAILS</summary>


To get started with local development in GitPod or your preferred IDE, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Install required packages (if project is already worked on)

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- Create an 'env.py file in the app's root directory for environment variables (if using CI template this should already exist).

- In the 'env.py file, add a secret key in this format:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "SECRET_KEY", 
    "<your chosen key goes here>"
)
```

- Add to settings.py in this format:

```
import os

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
```

- Start the server by running the following command:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

- Now you can access the application by opening the provided URL in your browser (add your browser url to allowed hosts).

`ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<browser URL>']`

</details>

### Production Deployment

<details><summary>DETAILS</summary>

        
Prepare the Django Project:

- Ensure your Django project is properly configured and runs smoothly locally.
- Make sure you have a requirements.txt file listing all Python dependencies required for your project.
- Ensure your project's settings are set up to work in a production environment (e.g., DEBUG = False, static files configuration, database settings).

Create a Procfile:
- Heroku uses a Procfile to determine how to run your application.
- Create a file named Procfile (no file extension) in your project's root directory.
- Inside the Procfile, specify the command needed to run your Django application. 

For example:

`web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi`

Create a runtime.txt File:

- Heroku needs to know which Python version your application requires. Create a runtime.txt file in your project's root directory.
- Inside runtime.txt, specify the Python version.

For example:

`python-3.9.5`

Install Gunicorn:

- Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications, and it's commonly used for deploying Django applications.
- Install Gunicorn and add it to your requirements.txt file:

`pip install gunicorn`
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Set Up Database:

See [ElephantSQL](####-ElephantSQL-Database)

Ad Heroku to allowed hosts in settins.py:

`ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<browser URL>', '.herokuapp.com']`

Collect Static Files:

If your project uses static files, collect them using Django's collectstatic command:

`heroku run python manage.py collectstatic`

Commit your changes to Git:

`git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"`

Create a new app on Heroku:
- Head over to heroku and log in. Choose 'create new app'.
- Choose a name for your app and your location. Hit 'create app'.
- Select the 'Settings' tab.
- In Config Vars, reveal config vars.
- Enter the config variables used in your env.py file.
- For example:
  - CLOUDINARY_URL
  - DATABASE_URL
  - EMAIL_USER - (gmail address)
  - EMAIL_PASS- (gmail password)
  - SECRET_KEY (The Django secret key is a crucial security setting used to provide cryptographic signing.)
   
    It is used for:
    - Security: The secret key is used to generate hashes for password reset tokens, user session tokens, and other cryptographic signatures. It helps protect against various security threats such as session hijacking, data tampering, and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
    - Session Management: Django uses the secret key to sign and verify session cookies. This ensures that the session data stored in cookies cannot be tampered with by malicious users.
    - CSRF Protection: Django uses the secret key to create tokens for preventing CSRF attacks. When a form is rendered, Django includes a hidden CSRF token in the form. When the form is submitted, Django verifies that the CSRF token matches the one generated for the user's session, thus preventing CSRF attacks.
    - Cryptographic Signatures: The secret key is used to sign various pieces of data within Django, such as cookies, messages, and tokens. This allows Django to verify the integrity and authenticity of these pieces of data.
    - Given its critical role in security and various Django functionalities, it's essential to keep the secret key secret and never share it publicly or with unauthorized individuals. If the secret key is compromised, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities in your Django application.

- Head over to the Deploy tab.
- Select Github (you will need to authorize this).
- Choose your repository.
- Manually deploy the main branch of this GitHub repo.
- You can now view your app.
