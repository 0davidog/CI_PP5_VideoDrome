### Project Backlog

Due to the small scope of this project, having a project backlog and seperate iterations didn't seem neccessary as their would only be one project to client hand-over. It was instead decided to keep all the user stories in the one project iteration list. A project backlog milestone was created however on github to follow agile practice.

### Iteration 01 â€“ Due 04/06/2024
